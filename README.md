# Virtual Teammate Veetee

## Introduction

*Veetee* is a chatbot engineered as a virtual assistant or virtual teammate. it is built with [rasa open source](https://rasa.com/open-source/). Rasa works on intentions, stories and actions.  When a user is typing something, the AI needs to determine the *intention*.  This alings with a *story*. What follows a story is an *action*.  This can be a simple response or a run of a python script.  

Rasa is very extensible and once an understanding of how it works was achieved a docker container followed by a Kubernetes deployment were constructed.
