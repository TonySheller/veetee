# K8s Folder

This folder will contain the deployment yaml for Veetee.  

The first thing to try would be to use the K8s installed as part of K8s.  
- Getting a cluster running on Windows 10 with Docker desktop is so easy. This is a great initial start. 

Now start creating the yaml for the deployment.
